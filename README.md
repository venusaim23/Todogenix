# Todogenix

A smart personal voice assistant using [Alan AI](https://alan.app/).

## Intro

Todogenix is a personal assistant app powered by Alan AI that helps store and manage our daily tasks in three categories Explorer, Flexible and Strict. We can sort our tasks into these three categories based upon our priorities and interests. The best part is that we can relax and navigate the entire application just by voice after logging in. Alan AI does everything possible for us. This might be very helpful for physically challenged people.

## Main Features

### Todo List

We can store and manage our daily tasks into three categories namely Explorer, Flexible and Strict modes. Explorer task takes only the task title and description whereas the other two tasks additionally require the deadline and duration of the task. The only difference between flexible and strict tasks is the ability to change the deadline.<br><br>
If you want to explore a different career choice, learn or try out something different apart from the daily routine that doesn't require any commitment to deadlines, you should addan explorer task.<br><br>
Many people like to practice flexibility in their daily timings. Depending on our priorities, and frequent changes in university/office schedules, we might want to adapt to changes in our daily rountine and frequently change our plans. In that case, flexible tasks can be added to our todo list where we have the ability to modify our task.<br><br>
Even if we want to manage our routine flexibly, there are certain things that we have to complete on time. Our meeting timings for example are not subject to change frequently. In that scenario, strict tasks have to be created, which once created cannot be modified at all.<br><br>
And yes, all of it can be done without even touching your smart phone or laptop by voice commands.

### Pomodoro Timer

[Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a popular technique for improving our time management skills. Todogenix provides a timer set to 25 minutes by default. The user can start, pause, reset the timer and take breaks in between. The work time is retained when the user takes a break, so they can keep a track of time they actually spent to work on a particular task. All the times can be changed as per the user convinience in the application.<br><br>
Again all of it can be done either by using pointing devices, by touch or simply by voice.

## Other Features

### Friendly User Interface

The application is very user friendly. Alan, the voice assistant for Todogenix would guide you through the entire application once you open it. If you need any help, just say `Hey Alan` and ask away. Alan is well trained to deliver his best answer to you. You can even have small talks with Alan and enjoy some moments.
